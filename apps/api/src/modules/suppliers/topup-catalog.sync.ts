/**
 * ============================================================================
 * Top-up catalog sync — availability only, never a price
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR
 *
 * A venue stops offering a package. Nobody tells us. The storefront keeps
 * showing it, the customer picks it, and the failure lands at quote time — or
 * worse, after payment. This sync is the thing that notices.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS *NOT* FOR
 *
 * It does NOT price anything. The customer's price is computed at quote time
 * from a live read of the venue's rate, and `QuotesService` already refuses to
 * fall back to a stored cost (see `liveTopUpPrice`). Writing a cost here would
 * be writing a number into the database that looks authoritative and is stale
 * the moment the venue's rate moves — which it does, hourly. So `costAmount` is
 * deliberately absent from every type in this file.
 *
 * The two switches are different things and this service only touches one:
 *
 *   - `isListed`  — does the venue still offer it?      ← THIS SERVICE OWNS IT
 *   - `isActive`  — has an operator put it on sale?     ← THE OPERATOR'S, NEVER TOUCHED
 *
 * `isActive` is the product owner's curation switch. A sync that flipped it on
 * would put an unreviewed product in front of a customer the moment a venue
 * added it, which is exactly what the seeded-inactive design exists to prevent.
 * `applyAvailability` is therefore written to leave it alone even when the row
 * is being marked listed again.
 *
 * FAILURE POLICY: ALL OR NOTHING
 *
 * The catalogue is fetched in full before a single row is written. A venue that
 * answers halfway, or a network that drops mid-read, would otherwise leave us
 * with half a catalogue and mass-delist everything we did not get to — turning
 * a transient outage into a storefront that looks empty. If the read fails, the
 * database is not touched at all and the caller gets the error.

 *
 * The listing rule is identity by provider SKU — the venue's own key, never a
 * price, because two live offers routinely share a price. The SKU is composed
 * by `topUpProviderSku`, the same function that hands a quote the SKU to price,
 * so what the venue returns is compared against exactly what we would buy. The
 * venue answers in full SKUs (`stars:50`, or `telegram:stars:50` for the
 * namespaced Telegram catalogue); matching them against a bare offer id would
 * recognise nothing and delist every row.
